# BCGX-GEN-AI-VIRTUAL INTERNSHIP

## INTRODUCTION
The AI-Powered Financial Chatbot project! This initiative, developed by me and the GenAI consulting team at Boston Consulting Group (BCG), it aims to leverage generative AI to analyze and interpret financial documents, specifically 10-K and 10-Q reports. Our goal is to build an intelligent chatbot that not only extracts and analyzes key financial data but also provides actionable insights in an interactive and user-friendly manner.The task was to build a simple rule based logic chatbot to answer queries about financial data. The primary objective of this project is to :
-	Extract and Analyze Financial Data: Automatically extract key financial metrics and information from 10-K and 10-Q documents.
-	Identify Significant Trends: Use data analysis techniques to identify and highlight significant trends and patterns in the financial data.
-	Generate Insights: Provide insights and interpretations of the data that are useful for strategic decision-making.
-	reate a chtbot to communicate insights from the data to users.

### Data Collection and Preparation
Document Gathering: Collect 10-K and 10-Q reports from GFC's database and public sources.
Data Extraction Techniques
Manual Extraction: Manually review documents to understand their layout and locate key information.
Highlight and Annotate: Use digital tools to highlight and annotate key figures and notes for easy reference.
Excel and Spreadsheet Tools: Input key figures into a spreadsheet for analysis and comparison.
Step 3: Data Cleaning and Transformation
Data Cleaning: Correct or remove incorrect, corrupted, or duplicate data. Techniques include filling in missing values, smoothing noisy data, and resolving inconsistencies.
Data Transformation: Normalize and standardize data for consistency. Convert financial figures to a consistent format (e.g., all figures in thousands or millions) and currency changes where necessary.
Step 4: Pre-processing for AI Models
Feature Engineering: In this data we created ratios like revenue growth and income growth to show financial health from the data.
Key Takeaways:
Preparing and pre-processing data is crucial for successfully applying AI in finance. Ensuring that the data fed into AI models is clean, consistent, and well-structured maximizes the model's ability to learn, make accurate predictions, and provide valuable insights. This stage involves both technical execution and understanding the financial context and relevance of the data being processed. By mastering these skills, financial data can be effectively prepared and pre-processed, making it ready for AI-driven applications.

### AI Chatbot Development
Rule-based Logic Start with rule-based responses using "if-then" logic to handle frequently asked questions about financial data.
State Management Maintain the conversation context to provide relevant and personalized responses.
Error Handling Ensure the chatbot gracefully handles unrecognized queries and guides users to appropriate questions.
Integrating Financial Data
Data Structuring: Organize financial data in CSV formats for easy access and interpretation.
### Limitations 
- The chatbot can only respond to 15 predetermined queries.
- The user interface of the chatbot is limited.
- The chatbot cannot handle complex queries.
